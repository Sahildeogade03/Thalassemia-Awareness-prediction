# Thalassemia Awareness Project

## Introduction
Thalassemia Awareness is a web-based project aimed at providing information about thalassemia, its treatment, prevention, and tools for predicting the likelihood of the disease based on certain health metrics. The project consists of an informational webpage and a prediction tool.

## Theory
Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder that affects the body's ability to produce normal hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that allows the red blood cells to transport oxygen throughout the body, nourishing other cells. In individuals with thalassemia, the body produces fewer healthy hemoglobin proteins, resulting in fewer and less healthy red blood cells. This can cause various health issues, including anemia, fatigue, and more serious complications if left untreated.

## Objectives of the Project:
**Raise Awareness:** Provide comprehensive information about thalassemia, its causes, symptoms, and treatments to educate the public and raise awareness.
**Predictive Tool:** Implement a predictive tool that uses machine learning to estimate the likelihood of an individual having thalassemia based on input health metrics such as RBC count, Hemoglobin level, MCV, MCH, and MCHC.
**Resource Hub:** Serve as a resource hub where users can find contact information for doctors and healthcare providers specializing in thalassemia treatment.
